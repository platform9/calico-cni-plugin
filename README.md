## This is a fork of https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin 
We are making fixes for security vulnerabilities reported by Trivy here 

## Source code moved for the upstream repo https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin
As of Release 3.18, Calico did not use a mono-repo. For higher versions since 3.22, the Calico source code for this repository has been moved to https://github.com/projectcalico/calico as part of ongoing efforts to improve
the developer experience. 

Please note that this repository is no longer in use, and future development on the Calico CNI plugin will occur in the new location.
